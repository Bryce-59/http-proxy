# About the Project
A program created in 2022 to simulate a TCP proxy through HTTP.

# How to Use
Use the `make run` or `make run-log` command to start the program from the Makefile. 

Alternatively, directly enter `python3 ./proxy.py $(PORT)` into the terminal.
To see output, you must configure your computer's internet browser to pass traffic
through the proxy.
